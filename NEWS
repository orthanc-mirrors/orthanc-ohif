Pending changes in the mainline
===============================


Version 1.5 (2025-01-17)
========================

* Updated OHIF to 3.9.2
* In "dicom-web" data source, fixed the default "app-config.js"
  configuration to enable display of PDFs.
* Updated cached "dicom-json" version to 2. This implies that, when using
  the "dicom-json" source, the cached metadata will have to be recomputed
  the first time you open a study.


Version 1.4 (2024-11-26)
========================

* Updated OHIF to 3.9.1
* The default value for the "DataSource" configuration is now "dicom-web"
  instead of "dicom-json" since "dicom-web" is usually
  more optimized.


Version 1.3 (2024-07-12)
========================

* Updated OHIF to 3.8.3
* Enabled support for segmentation and microscopy modes
  Note that the microscopy mode is not stable yet in OHIF!


Version 1.2 (2024-01-04)
========================

* Fixed wrong MIME type for app-config.js that prevents the OHIF
  viewer from loading with Orthanc 1.12.2


Version 1.1 (2023-11-24)
========================

* Updated OHIF to 3.7.0
* The default configuration has been adapted to avoid unneccesary
  transcoding on Orthanc side
* Patch to make the build of static assets reproducible, following a
  suggestion by Bernhard M. Wiedemann (bwiedemann@suse.de)


Version 1.0 (2023-06-19)
========================

=> Minimum SDK version: 1.0.0 <=

* Initial release
